# ardor-identity-verification
A repository for the identity verification token claim process

The following token should verify the identity of some.ones second Ardor testnet account: ARDOR-4TGA-X2NT-875X-BH5X5. You can validate it by searching for the idVerConChallengeText[0] account property of this account. If you don't have a running node, you can use the official remote node https://testardor.jelurida.com/index.html. When you've found the property check if it has the following value: "ArdorIdentityChallenge:v0.9.0:ARDOR-4TGA-X2NT-875X-BH5X5:github:1547089950" and was set by some.ones first Ardor testnet account: ARDOR-5TT2-VS3T-EUTS-7WDBA. You can further validate it if you open the referenced transaction and find the url of this repo inside the transaction message. If you finally validate that the token is indeed created with the ARDOR-4TGA-X2NT-875X-BH5X5 account and the challenge text shown as property value, you have fully verified the connection between the Ardor account and the github account created this text
