# ardor-identity-verification
A repository for the identity verification token claim process

The following token is used to verify the link between some.one and it's second Ardor testnet account: ARDOR-4TGA-X2NT-875X-BH5X5. You can validate it by searching for the idVerConChallengeText[0] account property of this account. If you don't have a running node, you can use Jeluridas (https://testardor.jelurida.com) or some.ones (https://testardor.some.one) remote node. After you've found the property, check if the token was set by some.ones first Ardor testnet account: ARDOR-5TT2-VS3T-EUTS-7WDBA (which acts as the contract runner) and is indeed created with the ARDOR-4TGA-X2NT-875X-BH5X5 account and the challenge text shown as property value. If this is the case, you have successfully validated the connection between some.one and ARDOR-4TGA-X2NT-875X-BH5X5. 
You can further validate the online resource if you open the referenced transaction and find the url of this repository inside the transaction message.
